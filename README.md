# RNASeq_analysis_LungAdenocarcinoma

The data herein described is relative to patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung. This type of cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. For the 230 patients with sigificant differences in gene mutation, aberrations in the genes NF1, MET, ERBB2 and RIT1 are present in 13% of the cases. Also, EGFR mutations were more abundant in female patients, whereas mutations in RBM10 were more frequent in males. Moreover, these genes were enriched in samples lacking an activated oncogene, suggesting a driver role for these events in certain tumours [1].

The "data" dataset contains expression data from the 515 patients involved in the study whereas the "meta_patients" dataset is in regard to several nominal and numeric atributes of each patient
